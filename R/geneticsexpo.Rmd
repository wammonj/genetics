# How to work with this data to see interesting patterns

This is a very **IMPORTANT** document.  You can tell because I **bolded** and CAPITALIZED the word important instead of stressing the word using *italics*.

## Clinic Data

Clinics are great places to gather data.  This is no exception.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```
